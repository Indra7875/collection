#### Introduction to Data Structures :
- It is a way to organize the data.
- After organizing the data it becomes easy to process it.
- e.g. Unorganized Books Vs Organized Books on book shell.

#### Types of Data Structures :
1. Liner Data Structure :
- In Liner Data Structure data is arranged in sequently manner, so easy to traversal.
- It is stored in single level.
- It is easy to implement.
- e.g. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue

2. Non-Liner Data Structure :
- In Non-Liner Data Structure data is arranged in non-sequently manner, so traversal is difficult.
- It is difficult to implement.
- It is stored in multi level.
- e.g. Tree, Graph
